# 3D-Printed-SiOC-Thesis-
This repository contains the code, data, and visualizations for my thesis on 3D Printed SiOC Ceramic Scaffolds from Preceramic Polymers
It demonstrates my skills in Python-based data analysis and visualization, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy to process and analyze experimental data, including mechanical properties, microstructure, and thermal stability of SiOC scaffolds. The repository is organized into:data/: Raw and processed datasets from 3D printing and material characterization.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
src/: Reusable Python scripts for analysis and plotting.
figures/: Generated plots and visualizations.

Explore the notebooks to see how Python is used to derive insights from complex materials science data. Instructions for running the code are in the README.
